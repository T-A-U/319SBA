# SBA 319: MongoDB Database Application (Assignment)

## Assignment Introduction
This assessment measures your understanding of MongoDB and your capability to implement its features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

## Objectives
- Create a server application with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Create a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
- Create MongoDB indexes.
- Use MongoDB indexing to make efficient queries.
- Create MongoDB validation rules.
- Use MongoDB validation to ensure data consistency.




## Introduction/Purpose
This application showcases my backend development of API routes and use of the MongoDB database. I am using Node, Express and MongoDB as well as Mongoose. I have CRUs APIs and mongo indexes as well. I tried to create validation, but it is giving an error so it is commented out.  

## Each route does the following:

//Gets all games and returns them in a list
app.get('/')

//Creates a single game in the database
app.post('/games')

//Creates a single anime in the database
app.post('/anime')

//Creates a single console in the database
app.post('/consoles)

//Updates a single game name
app.put("/:id")

//Deletes a single game from the list
app.delete('/:id')

And app.listen listens on a specific port.
